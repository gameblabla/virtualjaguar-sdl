Virtual Jaguar v1.0.7 GCC/SDL release INSTALL
---------------------------------------------


REQUIREMENTS:
-------------

To compile Virtual Jaguar you need to check if you have the minimum
requirements for compiling the sources:

- GCC v2.95 or v3.x;
- SDL v1.2.5 or higher;
- ZLIB v1.1.4
- OpenGL libraries
- supported OS (BeOS, Linux, FreeBSD and WIN32 through mingw); other OSs may
  work to but you may need to change some items in the Makefile and compile
  script.

Optionally you need a Atari Jaguar boot ROM (and/or CD boot ROM) which is
available on the Internet. We can't include the boot ROM since it's still
copyrighted.


COMPILING:
----------

If you sure you have the minimum software requirements, you can safely compile
Virtual Jaguar by issuing the following command in the directory where you
decompressed the source:

./compile

Optionally you can manually strip vj[.exe] to downsize the binary. If you have
upx in your path somewhere, you can uncomment the line in the makefile that
executes upx so that you'll end up with a somewhat smaller binary.
 
That's it! You're done! You can now start the emulator with ./vj. See the
output for more details or consult the README file for more info.
